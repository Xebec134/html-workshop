            <p>I started my web development journey by learning HTML with YouTube and freeCodeCamp. After, I learnt how to style webpages with CSS.

After learning how to build websites the three, I tried building websites on my own which proved very difficult at first, but with time I was able to grasp the concepts and build responsive websites. I hosted some of these projects with Github Pages. To use GitHub Pages, I had to learn how to use Git and GitHub. The first site I hosted was a Survey form.
